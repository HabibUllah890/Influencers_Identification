# Influencer Identification Project

## Overview
This project explores a data-driven approach to identifying social media influencers. Using a dataset of top TikTok influencers, the study applies **K-Means clustering** to create influencer profiles and employs **heuristic search algorithms**—Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing—to find influencers that best match a target profile.

## Purpose
The project provides a framework for analyzing influencer engagement metrics beyond basic follower counts, helping to identify suitable influencers for marketing campaigns.

## Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation** – Load and preprocess TikTok influencer data.  
2. **Clustering** – Apply K-Means to segment influencers into profiles.  
3. **Target Profile Selection** – Choose a cluster to define the desired influencer characteristics.  
4. **Heuristic Search** – Use Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing to find influencers that match the target profile.  
5. **Evaluation** – Assess and compare results based on engagement metrics.  

## Features
- Segment influencers into distinct profiles using K-Means clustering.  
- Identify influencers that match a target profile using Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing.  
- Compare performance and results of the two heuristic algorithms.  
- Configurable parameters for clustering and search algorithms.  
- Visualization of influencer clusters and search results.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language for data analysis and algorithms  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data processing and numerical computation  
- **Scikit-learn** – K-Means clustering implementation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
